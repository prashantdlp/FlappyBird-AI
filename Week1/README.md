<h1 align="center"><strong>Welcome to Week-1!</strong></h1>

In Week-1, we’ll cover the basics of **Python**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **PyGame** — everything you’ll need before building your Flappy Bird RL environment and Q-Learning agent.

---

## Goal of this week:

1. Get comfortable writing and running Python code  
2. Learn how to manipulate data using NumPy  
3. Create simple plots using Matplotlib  
4. Understand how PyGame works to build interactive games

## 🧩 **1. Python Resources**

Throughout this project, we’ll primarily use **Python** as a coding language. These resources will make you familiar with 

- Data types & variables  
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets  
- Loops & conditionals  
- Functions & classes  
- File I/O (reading/writing files)

### 🔗 Recommended Resources
- 🌐 [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)  
- 🎥 [Python Basics Playlist – Tech With Tim](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-mFu00qxl0a67RhjjZj3jXm&feature=shared)

It is fine to just get a basic idea of this and not go into details of this.
### 📝 Practice Ideas
- Write a function that prints numbers divisible by 3 from 1–100  
- Store player scores in a dictionary and print the highest scorer  
- Write a program that reads and writes to a text file  

---

## 💻 **2. Google Colab Resources**

We’ll use **Google Colab** for notebook-style coding exercises.  
Colab provides:

- Python notebooks  
- Free GPUs/TPUs  
- Easy debugging through code cells

## 🔢 **3. NumPy Resources**

**NumPy** is essential for AI/ML:

- Array operations  
- Linear algebra  
- Random number generation  
- Efficient Q-table storage later in RL  

### 🔗 Recommended Resource
- 🌐 [W3Schools NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp)

### 📝 Practice Ideas
- Create a 2D array & compute mean, max, min  
- Generate a random matrix and add two matrices element-wise  
- Save/load arrays using `np.save()` and `np.load()`  

---

## 📊 **4. Matplotlib Resources**

We'll use **Matplotlib** to visualize training:

- Episode rewards  
- Moving averages  
- Q-value trends  

### 🔗 Recommended Resource
- 🌐 [Matplotlib Official Website](https://matplotlib.org/)

### 📝 Practice Ideas
- Plot `y = x²` for `x = 0…10`  
- Plot a random reward curve  
- Label axes, add titles, legends  

---

## 🎮 **5. PyGame Resources**

We’ll use **PyGame** to build the Flappy Bird environment.  
You’ll learn:

- The game loop (update → draw → events)  
- Bird physics (gravity, flap velocity)  
- Obstacle movement  
- Collision detection  

### 🔗 Recommended Resources
- 🎥 [PyGame Tutorial for Beginners – freeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/FfWpgLFMI7w?feature=shared)  
- 🌐 [PyGame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

### 📝 Practice Ideas
- Draw a moving circle ("bird")  
- Implement gravity + flap  
- Add rectangles as obstacles and detect collisions

<h1 align="center">✅ End of Week-1 Goals</h1>

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Write Python scripts & functions confidently  
2. Use NumPy for basic operations  
3. Visualize data using Matplotlib  
4. Build a simple interactive PyGame window
